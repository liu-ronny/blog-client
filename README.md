## Overview

This is a personal blog application that includes a content management dashboard. The frontend was built using Next.js, and the backend was built using Node.js and MongoDB.

## Contents

This repository contains the frontend code for the application. The backend code is hosted [here](https://github.com/liu-ronny/blog-server). The frontend is currently a work-in-progress, and some features still need to be completed. Currently, it serves dummy data and needs to be connected to the backend once it is ready. To view fleshed out and fully tested code, please see the backend page.
